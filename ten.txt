Ans: Benefits of Agile include improved flexibility, faster delivery, better customer collaboration, higher quality through continuous feedback, and early detection of issues.

4. What is Scrum?
Ans: Scrum is a popular Agile framework that uses fixed-length iterations called sprints to develop software. It emphasizes collaboration, continuous feedback, and incremental progress.

5. What are the roles in Scrum?
Ans: Scrum has three key roles: Product Owner (defines product backlog and priorities), Scrum Master (facilitates Scrum process), and Development Team (builds the product).

6. What is a Sprint in Scrum?
Ans: A Sprint is a time-boxed iteration (usually 1?4 weeks) in Scrum where a team works on a predefined set of features or tasks. At the end of the sprint, a potentially shippable product increment is delivered.

7. What is a Product Backlog in Scrum?
Ans: The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes that are planned for future releases. It is maintained and refined by the Product Owner.

8. What is a Sprint Backlog in Scrum?
Ans: The Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks and user stories the team plans to complete during a sprint. It is derived from the Product Backlog and is owned by the development team.

9. What is a Daily Scrum meeting?
Ans: The Daily Scrum (also called the Daily Standup) is a short meeting where the development team discusses progress, potential blockers, and goals for the day. It helps ensure alignment and transparency.

10. What is a Scrum Master's role?
Answer-10: The Scrum Master acts as a facilitator and coach for the Scrum team, helping to remove impediments, protect the team from external distractions, and ensure the Scrum process is followed.

11. What is a Product Owner?s role?
Ans: The Product Owner represents the stakeholders and is responsible for defining and prioritizing the Product Backlog. They ensure the team works on the most valuable tasks.

12. What is a Burndown Chart in Scrum?
Ans: A Burndown Chart is a graphical representation of the work remaining in a sprint or project, showing progress toward completing the sprint goals over time.

13. What is the difference between Agile and Waterfall methodologies?
Ans: Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing for frequent changes, while Waterfall is linear and sequential with well-defined phases that are difficult to change once started.

14. What is a user story in Agile?
Ans: A user story is a short, simple description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of the end-user. It helps guide the development and provides context for the team.

15. What are the characteristics of a good user story?
Ans: A good user story is clear, concise, testable, valuable to the customer, and independent (can be developed and tested without dependencies).

16. What is Sprint Planning?
Ans: Sprint Planning is a meeting at the beginning of each sprint where the team decides what work to accomplish from the Product Backlog and how to achieve it.

17. What is Sprint Retrospective?
Ans: Sprint Retrospective is a meeting at the end of a sprint where the team reflects on the process, discusses what went well, and identifies improvements for future sprints.

18. What is Continuous Integration (CI) in Agile?
Ans: Continuous Integration is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, ensuring the software is always in a deployable state.

19. What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?
Ans: Continuous Delivery is a practice where code changes are automatically prepared for release to production, ensuring faster delivery and reducing the risk of errors.

20. What is a Release Burnup Chart?
Ans: A Release Burnup Chart tracks the progress of a team toward completing a set of features or a project over time, showing work completed versus work remaining.

21. What is a Scrum board?
Ans: A Scrum board is a visual tool used to track work during a sprint. It typically contains columns for "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" tasks.

22. What is the difference between Scrum and Kanban?
Ans: Scrum uses time-boxed sprints and specific roles, while Kanban is a flow-based method with continuous delivery, focusing on visualizing workflow and limiting work in progress.

23. What are the key roles in an Agile team?
Ans: Key roles include the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team, each with distinct responsibilities in guiding the project.

24. What are the benefits of Agile project management?
Ans: Benefits include increased adaptability to changes, better stakeholder engagement, higher customer satisfaction, improved team morale, and faster delivery.

25. What is velocity in Scrum?
Answer-34: Velocity is a measure of the amount of work a team can complete in a sprint, typically expressed in story points or hours. It helps predict future sprint capacity.

26. What is a "timebox" in Agile?
Ans: A timebox is a fixed duration within which an activity, such as a sprint or a meeting, must be completed. It helps manage time and resources effectively.

27. What is a "Definition of Done" (DoD)?
Ans: The Definition of Done is a shared understanding within the team of the criteria that must be met for work to be considered complete, ensuring consistency and quality.

28. How do you measure progress in Agile?
Ans: Progress in Agile is measured through frequent reviews, burndown charts, and customer feedback. The focus is on delivering working software frequently.


29. What is the concept of "timeboxing" in Agile?
Ans: Timeboxing in Agile refers to limiting the duration of specific tasks or phases (like sprints, meetings, or reviews), ensuring focused and efficient work.

30. How does Agile support collaboration between teams and stakeholders?
Ans: Agile encourages continuous communication, regular feedback loops, and collaboration through daily standups, sprint reviews, and close interaction with stakeholders.

31. What is an Agile Sprint Goal?
Ans: An Agile Sprint Goal is a concise, clear statement that defines what the team aims to achieve by the end of the sprint, providing focus and direction.

32. What is a Kanban board in Agile?
Ans: A Kanban board is a visual tool used in Agile to manage workflow by visualizing tasks and their current status, typically with columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

33. What is the role of a Development Team in Agile?

It does not support user management features	Provides built-in user management

19. What is a branch?
A branch in Git is like a separate line of work. It lets you make changes to your project without affecting the main version (usually called the main or master branch).
